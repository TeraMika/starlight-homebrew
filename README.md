# starlight-homebrew
Homebrew JSONs for 5etools.

All of the JSONs are kept in source_jsons.

Each JSON's source tag is one of the following:
- `Starlight` refers to core rules additions: conditions, basic actions, spells or items that are not setting specific
-  -> This will be the display name on any, even if the source JSON would be titled individually otherwise (e.g.: `Starlight: Conditions`)
- `Starlight: Content` is for any features that would be grouped and extend outside of one group (such as a class or subclass having its own invocation-style feature tree, or spells).
-  -> For example, `Starlight: Kinesics`. This adds clarity when dealing with multiple optional features if they are added separately.
-  Content for Shifting Tides specifically will have `SToD` as the source, such as Sunshards or certain species.
